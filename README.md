## Task Description
For the final project, two tasks were used to accomplish the course. A sensor task and a motor task. The sensor task was in control of interfacing the encoder, line sensor, and IMU. The motor task was in control of the motors and determining the state based on data collected from the sensors. Each task ran with a period of 10ms. In order to ensure a faster response time from the sensors, the sensor task was given higher priority (2) than the motor task (1). Five shared variables were used: centroid, mode, R_pos, L_pose, and heading.
